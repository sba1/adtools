+@item checktags
+@cindex @code{checktags} function attribute
+The @code{checktags} tells the some parameters of the function are
+taglists. In turn it will enable tag-type checking at compile-time, by
+leveraging the extra information provided to enum-defined tags to which
+a @code{tagtype} attribute is associated. The check assumes that if a
+parameter is an integer constant to which a type is associated, then
+it must be followed by an argument of that type. If that is not the
+case, the usual compiling warning about mismatched types will be
+emitted.

 @item weak
 @cindex @code{weak} function attribute
 The @code{weak} attribute causes a declaration of an external symbol
 to be emitted as a weak symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily
 useful in defining library functions that can be overridden in user code,
 though it can also be used with non-function declarations.  The overriding

 enumerators that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
 program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
 of the deprecated enumerator, to enable users to easily find further
 information about why the enumerator is deprecated, or what they should
 do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses.
 
+@item tagtype
+@cindex @code{tagtype} enumerator attribute
+The @code{tagtype} attribute will associate an additional type to the
+enumerator constant that is leveraged by the compiler for
+@code{checktags}-attributed functions. For example, to define
+@code{WA_CustomScreen} and to teach that it it should be followed by a
+@code{struct Screen *} in that class of functions use:

+@smallexample
+enum @{
+  WA_CustomScreen __attribute__((tagtype(struct Screen *)))
