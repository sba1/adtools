+The @code{checktags} tells the some parameters of the function are
+taglists. In turn it will enable tag-type checking at compile-time, by
+leveraging the extra information provded to enum-defined tags to which
+a @code{tagtype} attribute is associated. The check assumes that if a
+parameter is an integer constant to which a type is associated, then
+it must be followed by an argument of that type. If that is not the
+case, the usual compiling warning about mismatched types will be
+emitted.

 @item weak
 @cindex @code{weak} function attribute
 The @code{weak} attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak
 symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily useful in defining
 library functions that can be overridden in user code, though it can
 also be used with non-function declarations.  Weak symbols are supported

 enumerators that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
 program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
 of the deprecated enumerator, to enable users to easily find further
 information about why the enumerator is deprecated, or what they should
 do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses.

+The @code{tagtype} attribute will associate an additional type to the
